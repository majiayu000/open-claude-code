    "reason": "This function patches Node.js fs module core methods (chown, chmod, stat, etc.) with error handlers. It wraps chmod, chown, stat and their sync variants to handle errors gracefully. This is the main patching function for graceful-fs library. Variable analysis: receives fs module object, modifies its methods with wrappers. Context: exported as main module from nYA wrapper at line 33361, used throughout graceful-fs initialization."

Both B (ReadStream) and Q (WriteStream) are proper stream implementations with proper initialization of fd, path, flags, encoding, etc. Used in graceful-fs to provide custom stream implementations."
